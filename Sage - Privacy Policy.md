In this Privacy Policy, “Personal Information” means any information relating to an identified or identifiable individual. We collect various types of Personal Information from or about you or your devices from various sources. In some cases, if you choose not to provide the requested Personal Information, you may not be able to use our Services. We will tell you if providing the Personal Information is required by law or under a contract and the consequences of failing to provide it.

## A. Personal Information You Provide to Us. {#a.-personal-information-you-provide-to-us.}

**Account Information**. We collect the Personal Information you provide us for account creation and authentication, including but not limited to your name, username, password, and email address. If you sign up using a social media account (e.g., Google) or researcher credentialing web services (e.g., ORCID), we will also receive Personal information from those social media services, based on the privacy settings you applied to these social media accounts. 

**Attestation Documents.** If you wish to validate your user account to be eligible to request access to certain functions, we may ask for documentation intended to verify your credentials, such as a letter from a signing official, a notarized letter, or a copy of your professional license.   
   
**Survey Information.** When you fill out a survey, we collect your responses, which, depending on the survey type, may include products or areas of interest, satisfaction, area of expertise, and agreement to terms.

**Communications**. If you contact us directly, we collect any Personal Information that you provide in your message to us. For example, when you participate in our public forum or when you contact our Customer Support Team at [info@sagebase.org](mailto:info@sagebase.org), we will receive your name or username, email address, the contents of the message, and any attachments that you may send to us. If you subscribe to our newsletter, we will collect your email address. When we send you emails, we track whether you open them to learn how to deliver a better customer experience and improve our Services.

**Careers.** If you decide to apply for a job with us, you may submit your contact information, such as your name, email address, and phone number, and your resume online. We will collect the Personal Information you choose to provide on your resume, such as your education and employment experience. You may also apply through career services such as LinkedIn. If you do so, we will collect the Personal Information you make available to us through these career services. 

**Payment Information.** If you make a purchase through our Services or donate money, we or our third-party payment processor collect and process your payment-related information, such as your name, purchase information, billing address, payment card information, and other transaction information.
